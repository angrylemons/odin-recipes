My first odin project web page, involving a recipe list and basic layout.

The original project idea was only HTML and basic layout, but I went a step further to personalize it and make it look more like actual modern website pages.

Coded with HTML and CSS.

I learned how to properly setup my HTML and CSS projects, instead of jsut uploading files to the ropository.
I learned proper git and github skills to keep my projects organized.
I learned more of CSS and utilized flexbox, shadows, and transparency.
